For the past fifty years located under the arch called “[the Arch] of the Banks” are five frames with images of the Holy Mary. The first three are painted on canvas, the fourth is printed on paper, and the fifth is painted in fresco on an oval-shaped stone. At the foot of the aforementioned paintings there three steps remain adapted to place lights each year on the 8th of September when the festival is held.
